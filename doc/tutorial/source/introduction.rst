Introduction
------------

The |ns3| simulator is a discrete-event network simulator targeted
primarily for research and educational use.  The
`ns-3 project
<http://www.nsnam.org>`_,
started in 2006, is an open-source project developing |ns3|.

The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce new |ns3| users to the
system in a structured way.  It is sometimes difficult for new users to
glean essential information from detailed manuals and to convert this
information into working simulations.  In this tutorial, we will build
several example simulations, introducing and explaining key concepts and
features as we go.

As the tutorial unfolds, we will introduce the full |ns3| documentation
and provide pointers to source code for those interested in delving deeper
into the workings of the system.

We also provide a quick start guide for those who are comfortable
diving right in without too much documentation.

A few key points are worth noting at the onset:

* |ns3| is open-source, and the project strives to maintain an
  open environment for researchers to contribute and share their software.
* |ns3| is not a backwards-compatible extension of `ns-2
  <http://www.isi.edu/nsnam/ns>`_;
  it is a new simulator.  The two simulators are both written in C++ but
  |ns3| is a new simulator that does not support the |ns2| APIs.


About ns-3
**********

|ns3| has been developed to provide an open, extensible network simulation
platform, for networking research and education.  In brief, |ns3| provides
models of how packet data networks work and perform, and provides a
simulation engine for users to conduct simulation experiments.  Some of the
reasons to use |ns3| include to perform studies that are more difficult
or not possible to perform with real systems, to study system behavior in
a highly controlled, reproducible environment, and to learn about how
networks work.  Users will note that the available model set in |ns3|
focuses on modeling how Internet protocols and networks work, but
|ns3| is not limited to Internet systems; several users are using
|ns3| to model non-Internet-based systems.

Many simulation tools exist for network simulation studies.  Below are
a few distinguishing features of |ns3| in contrast to other tools.

* |ns3| is designed as a set of libraries that can be combined together
  and also with other external software libraries.  While some simulation
  platforms provide users with a single, integrated graphical user
  interface environment in which all tasks are carried out, |ns3| is
  more modular in this regard.  Several external animators and
  data analysis and visualization tools can be used with |ns3|.  However,
  users should expect to work at the command line and with C++ and/or
  Python software development tools.
* |ns3| is primarily used on Linux or macOS systems, although support exists
  for BSD systems and also for Windows frameworks that can build Linux code,
  such as Windows Subsystem for Linux, or Cygwin.  Native Windows
  Visual Studio is not presently supported although a developer is working
  on future support.  Windows users may also use a Linux virtual machine.
* |ns3| is not an officially supported software product of any company.
  Support for |ns3| is done on a best-effort basis on the
  ns-3-users forum (ns-3-users@googlegroups.com).

For ns-2 Users
**************

For those familiar with |ns2| (a popular tool that preceded |ns3|),
the most visible outward change when moving to
|ns3| is the choice of scripting language.  Programs in |ns2| are
scripted in OTcl and results of simulations can be visualized using the
Network Animator nam.  It is not possible to run a simulation
in |ns2| purely from C++ (i.e., as a main() program without any OTcl).
Moreover, some components of |ns2| are written in C++ and others in OTcl.
In |ns3|, the simulator is written entirely in C++, with optional
Python bindings.  Simulation scripts can therefore be written in C++
or in Python.  New animators and visualizers are available and under
current development.  Since |ns3|
generates pcap packet trace files, other utilities can be used to
analyze traces as well.
In this tutorial, we will first concentrate on scripting
directly in C++ and interpreting results via trace files.

But there are similarities as well (both, for example, are based on C++
objects, and some code from |ns2| has already been ported to |ns3|).
We will try to highlight differences between |ns2| and |ns3|
as we proceed in this tutorial.

A question that we often hear is "Should I still use |ns2| or move to
|ns3|?"  In this author's opinion, unless the user is somehow vested
in |ns2| (either based on existing personal comfort with and knowledge
of |ns2|, or based on a specific simulation model that is only available
in |ns2|), a user will be more productive with |ns3| for the following
reasons:

* |ns3| is actively maintained with an active, responsive users mailing
  list, while |ns2| is only lightly maintained and has not seen
  significant development in its main code tree for over a decade.
* |ns3| provides features not available in |ns2|, such as a implementation
  code execution environment (allowing users to run real implementation
  code in the simulator)
* |ns3| provides a lower base level of abstraction compared with |ns2|,
  allowing it to align better with how real systems are put together.
  Some limitations found in |ns2| (such as supporting multiple types of
  interfaces on nodes correctly) have been remedied in |ns3|.

If in doubt, a good guideline would be to look at both simulators (as
well as other simulators), and in particular the models available
for your research, but keep in mind that your experience may be better
in using the tool that is being actively developed and
maintained (|ns3|).

Contributing
************

|ns3| is a research and educational simulator, by and for the
research community.  It will rely on the ongoing contributions of the
community to develop new models, debug or maintain existing ones, and share
results.  There are a few policies that we hope will encourage people to
contribute to |ns3| like they have for |ns2|:

* Open source licensing based on GNU GPLv2 compatibility
* `wiki
  <https://www.nsnam.org/wiki>`_
* `Contributed Code
  <https://www.nsnam.org/wiki/Contributed_Code>`_ page, similar to |ns2|'s popular Contributed Code
  `page
  <http://nsnam.isi.edu/nsnam/index.php/Contributed_Code>`_
* Use of GitLab.com including issue tracker
  <https://www.gitlab.com/nsnam>`_

We realize that if you are reading this document, contributing back to
the project is probably not your foremost concern at this point, but
we want you to be aware that contributing is in the spirit of the project and
that even the act of dropping us a note about your early experience
with |ns3| (e.g. "this tutorial section was not clear..."),
reports of stale documentation or comments in the code, etc. are much
appreciated.  The preferred way to submit patches is either to fork
our project on GitLab.com and generate a Merge Request, or to open
an issue on our issue tracker and append a patch.

Tutorial Organization
*********************

The tutorial assumes that new users might initially follow a path such as the
following:

* Try to download and build a copy;
* Try to run a few sample programs;
* Look at simulation output, and try to adjust it.

As a result, we have tried to organize the tutorial along the above
broad sequences of events.
